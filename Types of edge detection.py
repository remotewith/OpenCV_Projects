# edge detection is useful for a sharp change in the intensity or the color of the image
#basically detecting te line which seperates two different colors
#three types of methods r available
# 1 : sobel: not a good method used for horizontal and vertical detection(classical method)
# 2:  laplacian: another method for edge detection
# 3: most commonly used method CANNY
